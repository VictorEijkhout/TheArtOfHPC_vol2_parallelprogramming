This chapter explains the mechanisms for offloading work to a \acf{GPU},
introduced in \ompstandard{4.0}.

The memory of a processor and that of an attached \ac{GPU} are not
\emph{coherent}\index{coherent memory|see{memory, coherence}}:
there are separate memory spaces and writing data in one
is not automatically reflected in the other.

OpenMP transfers data (or maps it) when you enter an \indexompclause{target}
construct.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=omp]
#pragma omp target
{
  // do stuff on the GPU
}
\end{lstlisting}

You can test whether the target region is indeed executed on a device
with \indexompdef{omp_is_initial_device}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=omp]
#pragma omp target
  if (omp_is_initial_device()) printf("Offloading failed\n");
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 1 {Targets and tasks}

The \indexompclause{target} clause causes OpenMP to create a
\indextermsub{target}{task}.
This is a task running on the host, dedicated to managing the
offloaded region.

The \indexompclause{target} region is executed
by a new \indextermsub{initial}{task}.
This is distinct from the initial task that executes the main program.

The task that created the target task is called the
\indextermsub{generating}{task}.

By default, the generating task is blocked while the task on the device is running,
but adding the \indexompclause{target}{nowait} clause makes it asynchronous.
This requires a \indexompshow{taskwait} directive to synchronize host and device.

\Level 0 {Data on the device}

\begin{itemize}
\item Scalars are treated as \indexompclause{firstprivate}, that is,
  they are copied in but not out.
\item Stack arrays \indexompclause{tofrom}.
\item Heap arrays are not mapped by default.
\end{itemize}

For explicit mapping with \indexompclauseoption{target}{map}:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=omp]
#pragma omp target map(...)
{
  // do stuff on the GPU
}
\end{lstlisting}
The following map options exist:
\begin{itemize}
\item \lstinline+map(to: x,y,z)+ copy from host to device
  when entering the target region.
\item \lstinline+map(from: x,y,z)+ copy from devince to host
  when exiting the target region.
\item \lstinline+map(tofrom: x,y,z)+ is equivalent to combining the previous two.
\item \lstinline+map(allo: x,y,z)+ allocates data on the device.
\end{itemize}

\begin{fortrannote}{Array sizes in map clause}
  If the compiler can deduce the array bounds and size,
  it is not necessary to specify them in the `map' clause.
\end{fortrannote}

Data transfer to a device is probably slow,
so mapping the data at the start of an offloaded section of code
is probably not the best idea.
Additionally, in many cases data will stay resident on the device
throughout several iterations of, for instance, a time-stepping \ac{PDE} solver.
For such reasons, it is possible to move data onto, and off from,
the device explicitly,
using the \indexompclauseoption{target}{enter data} and
\indexompclauseoption{target}{exit data} directives.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=omp]
#pragma omp target enter data map(to: x,y)
#pragma omp target
{
  // do something
}
#pragma omp target enter data map(from: x,y)
\end{lstlisting}

Also \indexompclauseoption{target}{update to}
(synchronize data from host to device),
\indexompclauseoption{target}{update from}
(synchronize data to host from device).

\Level 0 {Execution on the device}
\label{sec:omp-team}

For parallel execution of a loop on the device
use the \indexompclause{teams} clause:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=omp]
#pragma omp target teams distribute parallel do
\end{lstlisting}

On GPU devices and the like, there is a structure to threads:
\begin{itemize}
\item threads are grouped in \indexompterm{team}s,
  and they can be synchronized only within these teams;
\item teams are groups in \indexompterm{league}s,
  and no synchronization between leagues is possible
  inside a \indexompshow{target} region.
\end{itemize}

The combination \n{teams distribute} splits the iteration space over teams.
By default a static schedule is used,
but the option \indexompclause{dist_schedule} can be used to specify a different one.
However, this combination only gives the chunk of space to the master thread
in each team.
Next we need \n{parallel for} or \n{parallel do} to spread the chunk over the
threads in the team.

When creating teams, it's often useful to limit the number of threads in each
with \indexclause{thread_limit}.
This can also be set with the \indexompdef{OMP_THREAD_LIMIT}
environment variable.
The value can be queried with \indexompdef{omp_get_thread_limit}.
