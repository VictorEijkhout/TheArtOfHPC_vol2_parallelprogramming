\Level 0 {Reduction}
\label{sec:allreduce}

\Level 1 {Reduce to all}

Above we saw a couple of scenarios where a quantity is reduced, with
all proceses getting the result. The MPI call for this is
%
\indexmpiref{MPI_Allreduce}.

Example: we give each process a random number, and sum these numbers together.
The result should be approximately $1/2$ times the number of processes.

\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/allreduce.c]{allreducec}

Or:

\cverbatimsnippet{reducecount}

\Level 2 {Buffer description}

This is the first example in this course that involves MPI data buffers:
the \indexmpishow{MPI_Allreduce} call contains two buffer arguments.
In most MPI calls (with the one-sided ones as big exception)
a buffer is described by three parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item a pointer to the data,
\item the number of items in the buffer, and
\item the datatype of the items in the buffer.
\end{enumerate}
Each of these needs some elucidation.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The buffer specification depends on the programming languages.
  Defailts are in section~\ref{sec:mpi-buffers}.
\item The count was a 4-byte integer in MPI standard
  up to and including~\mpistandard{3}.
  In the \mpistandard{4} standard the \indexmpishow{MPI_Count} data type
  become allowed. See section~\ref{sec:mpi-bigdata} for details.
\item Datatypes can be predefined, as in the above example, or user-defined.
  See chapter~\ref{ch:mpi-data} for details.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
  Routines with both a send and receive buffer should not alias these.
  Instead, see the discussion of \indexmpishow{MPI_IN_PLACE};
  section~\ref{sec:allreduce-inplace}.
\end{remark}

\Level 2 {Examples and exercises}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randommaxscale}
  Let each process compute a random number,
  and compute the sum of these numbers using the \indexmpishow{MPI_Allreduce}
  routine.
  \[ \xi = \sum_i x_i \]

  Each process then scales its value
  by this sum.
  \[ x_i' \leftarrow x_i/ \xi \]
  Compute the sum of the scaled numbers
  \[ \xi' = \sum_i x_i' \]
  and check that it is~1.
  \skeleton{randommax}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randommaxarray}
  Extend the previous exercise to letting each process have an array.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:fft-vector}
  Implement a (very simple-minded) Fourier transform: if $f$ is a
  function on the interval $[0,1]$, then the $n$-th Fourier
  coefficient is
  \[ f_n\hat = \int_0^1 f(t)e^{-2\pi x}\,dx \]
  which we approximate by
  \[ f_n\hat = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} f(ih)e^{-in\pi/N} \]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Make one distributed array for the $e^{-inh}$ coefficients,
  \item make one distributed array for the $f(ih)$ values
  \item calculate a couple of coefficients
  \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  In the previous exercise you worked with a distributed array,
  computing a local quantity and combining that into a global
  quantity.
  Why is it not a good idea to gather the whole distributed array on a
  single processor, and do all the computation locally?
\end{exercise}

\begin{mplnote}{Allreduce operator}
  Versions with separate send/receive buffers,
  and reduction in place:
  %
  \mplverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/collectscalar.cxx]{mplallreduce}
  %
  Note the parentheses after the operator.
  Also note that the operator comes first, not last as in the C~\ac{API}.

  Available: \lstinline{max}, \lstinline{min}, \lstinline{plus}, \lstinline{multiplies},
  \lstinline{logical_and}, \lstinline{logical_or}, \lstinline{logical_xor},
  \lstinline{bit_and}, \lstinline{bit_or}, \lstinline{bit_xor}.

  \begin{mplimpl}
    The reduction operator has to be compatible with
    \lstinline+T(T,T)>+.
  \end{mplimpl}
\end{mplnote}

For more about operators, see section~\ref{sec:mpi-ops}.

\Level 1 {Inner product as allreduce}
\label{sec:dist-reduc}

One of the more common applications of the reduction operation
is the \indexterm{inner product} computation. Typically, you have two vectors $x,y$
that have the same distribution, that is,
where all processes store equal parts of $x$ and~$y$.
The computation is then
\begin{lstlisting}
local_inprod = 0;
for (i=0; i<localsize; i++)
  local_inprod += x[i]*y[i];
MPI_Allreduce( &local_inprod, &global_inprod, 1,MPI_DOUBLE ... ) 
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:gramschmidt}
  The \indexterm{Gram-Schmidt} method is a simple way to orthogonalize
  two vectors:
  \[ u \leftarrow u- (u^tv)/(u^tu) \]
  Implement this, and check that the result is indeed orthogonal.

  Suggestion: fill $v$ with the values $\sin 2nh\pi$ where $n=2\pi/N$,
  and $u$ with $\sin 2nh\pi + \sin 4nh\pi$. What does $u$ become after orthogonalization?
\end{exercise}

\Level 1 {Reduction operations}
\label{sec:mpi:op-reduct}

Several \indexmpishow{MPI_Op} values are pre-defined. For the list,
see section~\ref{sec:operator-list}.

For use in reductions and scans it is possible to define your own operator.

\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Op_create( MPI_User_function *func, int commute, MPI_Op *op);
\end{lstlisting}

For more details, see section~\ref{sec:mpi-op-create}.

\Level 1 {Data buffers}
\label{sec:mpi-buffers}

Collectives are the first example you see of MPI routines that
involve transfer of user data. Here, and in every other case,
you see that the data description involves:
\begin{itemize}
\item A buffer. This can be a scalar or an array.
\item A datatype. This describes whether the buffer contains integers,
  single/double floating point numbers, or more complicated types, to
  be discussed later.
\item A count. This states how many of the elements of the given
  datatype are in the send buffer, or will be received into the receive buffer.
\end{itemize}
These three together describe what MPI needs to send through the network.

In the various languages such a buffer/count/datatype triplet is specified in
different ways.

First of all, in~\emph{C} the
\emph{buffer}\index{buffer!MPI, in C}
is always an \indexterm{opaque handle}, that is,
a \lstinline+void*+ parameter to which you supply an address.
This means that an MPI call can take two forms.

For scalars we need to use the ampersand operator to take the address:
\begin{lstlisting}
float x,y;
MPI_Allreduce( &x,&y,1,MPI_FLOAT, ... );
\end{lstlisting}
But for arrays we use the fact that arrays and addresses are more-or-less
equivalent in:
\begin{lstlisting}
float xx[2],yy[2];
MPI_Allreduce( xx,yy,2,MPI_FLOAT, ... );
\end{lstlisting}
You could \indexterm{cast} the buffers and write:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Allreduce( (void*)&x,(void*)&y,1,MPI_FLOAT, ... );
MPI_Allreduce( (void*)xx,(void*)yy,2,MPI_FLOAT, ... );
\end{lstlisting}
but that is not necessary. The compiler will not complain
if you leave out the cast.

\begin{cppnote}{Buffer treatment}
  Treatment of scalars in C++ is the same as in~C.
  However, for arrays you have the choice between C-style arrays,
  and \lstinline+std::vector+ or \lstinline+std::array+.
  For the latter there are two ways of dealing with buffers:
\begin{lstlisting}
vector<float> xx(25);
MPI_Send( xx.data(),25,MPI_FLOAT, .... );
MPI_Send( &xx[0],25,MPI_FLOAT, .... );
\end{lstlisting}
\end{cppnote}

\begin{fortrannote}{MPI send/recv buffers}
  In~\emph{Fortran} parameters are always passed by reference,
  so the \emph{buffer}\index{buffer!MPI, in Fortran}
  is treated the same way:
\begin{lstlisting}
Real*4 :: x
Real*4,dimension(2) :: xx
call MPI_Allreduce( x,1,MPI_REAL4, ... )
call MPI_Allreduce( xx,2,MPI_REAL4, ... )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fortrannote}

In discussing \ac{OO} languages, we first note that
the official C++ \ac{API} has been removed from the standard.

Specification of the buffer/count/datatype triplet is not
needed explicitly in \ac{OO} languages.

\begin{pythonnote}{Buffers from numpy}
  Most MPI routines in Python have both a variant that can send arbitrary Python data,
  and one that is based on \indexterm{numpy} arrays.
  The former looks the most `pythonic', and is very flexible,
  but is usually demonstrably inefficient.
  %
  \pverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/p/allreduce.py]{allreducep}

  In the numpy variant, all \emph{buffers}\index{buffer!MPI, in Python}
  are \indexterm{numpy} objects, which carry information about their type and size.
  For scalar reductions this means we have to create an array for the receive buffer,
  even though only one element is used.
  %
  \pverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/p/allreduce.py]{allreducenump}
\end{pythonnote}

\begin{pythonnote}{Buffers from subarrays}
  In many examples you will pass a whole Numpy array as send/receive buffer.
  Should want to use a buffer that corresponds to a subset of an array,
  you can use the following notation:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Whatever( buffer[...,5] # more stuff    
\end{lstlisting}
for passing the buffer that starts at location~5 of the array.

For even more complicated effects, use \n{numpy.frombuffer}:
\psnippetwithoutput{pyfrombuf}{examples/mpi/p}{buffer}

\end{pythonnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Scalar buffers}
  \label{mpl:buf-scalar}
  \emph{Buffer}\index{buffer!MPI, in MPL} type handling
  is done through polymorphism (templating and ADL): \\
  no explicit indication of types.

  Scalars are handled as such:
\begin{lstlisting}
float x,y;
comm.bcast( 0,x ); // note: root first
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mplnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Vector buffers}
  \label{mpl:vec-buf}
If your buffer is a \lstinline+std::vector+ you need
to take the \lstinline+.data()+ component of it:
\begin{lstlisting}
vector<float> xx(2),yy(2);
comm.allreduce( mpl::plus<float>(),
    xx.data(), yy.data(), mpl::contiguous_layout<float>(2) );
\end{lstlisting}
  The \indexmplshow{contiguous_layout} is a `derived type';
this will be discussed in more detail elsewhere
(see note~\ref{mpl:derived} and later).
For now, interpret it as a way of indicating the count/type
part of a buffer specification.
\end{mplnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Array buffers}
  \label{mpl:vec-arr}
  You can pass a C-style array as buffer, requiring a layout:
  %% \mplverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/collectarray.cxx]{mplallreducearray}
\begin{lstlisting}
// vector of 50 floats
vector<float> ar(50);
auto root = 0;
auto data = ar.data(); // or &(ar[0]) or &ar.front()
auto layout = mpl::contiguous_layout<float>(50)
comm_world::bcast( root,data,layout );
\end{lstlisting}
\end{mplnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Iterator buffers}
  \label{mpl:buf-itr}
  MPL point-to-point routines have a way of specifying the buffer(s)
  through a \lstinline{begin} and \lstinline{end} iterator.
  %
  \mplverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/sendrange.cxx]{mplsendrange}
  %
  Not available for collectives.
\end{mplnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Send vs recv buffer}
  There are separate variants for root vs non-root processes
  in rooted collectives:
  \mplverbatimsnippet{mplreduceroot}
\end{mplnote}

\Level 0 {Rooted collectives: broadcast, reduce}
\label{sec:rooted}

In some scenarios there is a certain process that has a privileged status.
\begin{itemize}
\item
  One process can generate or read in the initial data for a program
  run. This then needs to be communicated to all other processes.
\item
  At the end of a program run, often
  one process needs to output some summary information.
\end{itemize}
This process is called the \indexterm{root} process, and we will now
consider routines that have a root.

\Level 1 {Reduce to a root}
\label{sec:reduce-root}

In the broadcast operation a single data item was communicated to all
processes. A~reduction operation with
%
\indexmpiref{MPI_Reduce}
%
goes the other way: each process has a
data item, and these are all brought together into a single item.

Here are the essential elements of a reduction operation:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Reduce( senddata, recvdata..., operator,
    root, comm ); 
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{itemize}
\item There is the original data, and the data resulting from the
  reduction. It is a design decision of MPI that it will not by
  default overwrite the original data. The send data and receive data
  are of the same size and type: if every processor has one real
  number, the reduced result is again one real number.
\item It is possible to indicate explicitly that a single buffer
  is used, and thereby the original data overwritten;
  see section~\ref{sec:allreduce-inplace} for this `in place' mode.
\item There is a reduction operator. Popular choices are
  \indexmpishow{MPI_SUM}, \indexmpishow{MPI_PROD} and
  \indexmpishow{MPI_MAX}, but complicated operators such as finding
  the location of the maximum value exist.
  (For the full list, see section~\ref{sec:operator-list}.)
  You can also define your
  own operators; section~\ref{sec:mpi-op-create}.
\item There is a root process that receives the result of the
  reduction. Since the nonroot processes do not receive the reduced
  data, they can actually leave the receive buffer undefined.
\end{itemize}

\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/reduce.c]{reduce}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randommax}
  Write a program where each process computes a random number, and process~0
  finds and prints the maximum generated value. Let each process print its value,
  just to check the correctness of your program.
\begin{book}
  (See~\ref{ch:random} for a discussion of random number generation.)
\end{book}
\end{exercise}

Collective operations can also take an array argument, instead of just a scalar.
In that case, the operation is applied pointwise to each location in the array.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:randomcoord}
  Create on each process an array of length~2 integers, and put the
  values $1,2$ in it on each process. Do a sum reduction on that
  array. Can you predict what the result should be?  Code it. Was your
  prediction right?
\end{exercise}

\Level 1 {Reduce in place}
\label{sec:allreduce-inplace}

By default MPI will not overwrite the original data with the reduction
result, but you can tell it to do so
using the \indexmpidef{MPI_IN_PLACE} specifier:
%
\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/allreduceinplace.c]{allreduceinplace}
%
Now every process only has a receive buffer, so this
has the advantage of saving half the memory.
Each process puts its input values in the receive buffer,
and these are overwritten by the reduced result.

The above example used \indexmpishow{MPI_IN_PLACE} in
\indexmpishow{MPI_Allreduce};
in \indexmpishow{MPI_Reduce} it's little  tricky.
The reasoning is a follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item In \indexmpishow{MPI_Reduce} every process has a buffer to
  contribute, but only the root needs a receive buffer. Therefore,
  \indexmpishow{MPI_IN_PLACE} takes the place of the receive buffer
  on any processor except for the root~\ldots
\item \dots~while the root, which needs a receive buffer,
  has \indexmpishow{MPI_IN_PLACE} takes the place of the send buffer.
  In order to contribute its value, the root needs to put this in the
  receive buffer.
\end{itemize}

Here is one way you could write the in-place version of \indexmpishow{MPI_Reduce}:
%
\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/allreduceinplace.c]{onereduceinplace}
%
However, as a point of style, having different versions of a a collective
in different branches of a condition is infelicitous. The following may be preferable:
%
\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/allreduceinplace.c]{tworeduceinplace}

\begin{fortrannote}{In-place operations}
  In Fortran  you can not do these address calculations.
  You can use the solution with a conditional:
  %
  \fverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/f/reduceinplace.F90]{reduceinplace-f}
  %
  but you can also solve this with pointers:
  %
  \fverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/f08/reduceinplaceptr.F90]{reduceinplace-fptr}
\end{fortrannote}

\begin{pythonnote}{In-place collectives}
  The value \lstinline+MPI.IN_PLACE+ can be used for the send buffer:
  %
  \pverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/p/allreduceinplace.py]{allreduceip}
\end{pythonnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Reduce in place}
  The in-place variant is activated by
  specifying only one instead of two buffer arguments.
  %
  \mplverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/collectscalar.cxx]{mplallreduce}
  %
  Reducing a buffer requires specification of a \lstinline+contiguous_layout+:
  %
  \mplverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/collectbuffer.cxx]{mplallreducebuffer}
  %
  Note that the buffers are of type \lstinline+T *+, so it is necessary
  to take the \lstinline+data()+ of any \lstinline+std::vector+ and such.
\end{mplnote}

\Level 1 {Broadcast}
\label{sec:bcast}

A broadcast models the scenario where one process,
the `root' process,
owns some data, and it communicates it to all other processes.

The broadcast routine
\indexmpiref{MPI_Bcast}
has the following structure:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Bcast( data..., root , comm);
\end{lstlisting}
Here:
\begin{itemize}
\item There is only one buffer, the send buffer.
  Before the call, the root process has data in this buffer;
  the other processes allocate a same sized buffer, but
  for them the contents are irrelevant.
\item 
  The root is the process that is sending its data.
  Typically, it will be the root of a broadcast tree.
\end{itemize}

Example: in general we can not assume that all processes get the
\emph{commandline arguments}\index{commandline arguments!bradcast},
so we broadcast them from process~0.

\cverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/c/init.c]{usage}

\begin{comment}
  \begin{exercise}
    \label{ex:argv-bcast}
    If you give a commandline argument to a program, that argument is available
    as a character string as part of the \n{argv,argc} pair that you typically use
    as the arguments to your main program. You can use the function \n{atoi} to
    convert such a string to integer.

    Write a program where process~0 looks for an integer on the commandline, and
    broadcasts it to the other processes. Initialize the buffer on all processes, and
    let all processes print out the broadcast number,
    just to check that you solved the problem correctly.
  \end{exercise}
\end{comment}

\begin{pythonnote}{Sending objects}
  In python it is both possible to send objects, and to send more
  C-like buffers. The two possibilities correspond (see
  section~\ref{sec:python-bind}) to different routine names; the
  buffers have to be created as \n{numpy} objects.

  We illustrate both the general Python and numpy variants. 
  In the former variant the result is given as a function return;
  in the numpy variant the send buffer is reused.

\pverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/p/bcast.py]{bcastp}
\end{pythonnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Broadcast}
  The broadcast call comes in two variants, with scalar argument
  and general layout:
\begin{lstlisting}
 template<typename T >
void mpl::communicator::bcast
   ( int root_rank, T &data ) const;
void mpl::communicator::bcast
   ( int root_rank, T *data, const layout< T > &l ) const;
\end{lstlisting}
Note that the root argument comes first
in a departure from the C~\ac{API}.
\end{mplnote}

For the following exercise, study figure~\ref{fig:gauss-jordan-ex}.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:gaussjordancoll}
  The \indexterm{Gauss-Jordan algorithm} for solving a linear system
  with a matrix~$A$ (or computing its inverse) runs as follows:
  %{\small
  \begin{tabbing}
    for \=pivot $k=1,\ldots,n$\\
    \>let the vector of scalings $\ell^{(k)}_i=A_{ik}/A_{kk}$\\
    \>for \=row $r\not=k$\\
    \>\>for \=column $c=1,\ldots,n$\\
    \>\>\> $A_{rc}\leftarrow A_{rc} - \ell^{(k)}_r A_{kc}$\\
  \end{tabbing}
  %}
  where we ignore the update of the righthand side, or the formation
  of the inverse.

  Let a matrix be distributed with each process storing one
  column. Implement the Gauss-Jordan algorithm as a series of
  broadcasts: in iteration $k$ process $k$ computes and broadcasts the
  scaling vector~$\{\ell^{(k)}_i\}_i$. Replicate the right-hand side on
  all processors.
  \skeleton{jordan}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Add partial pivoting to your implementation of Gauss-Jordan elimination.

  Change your implementation to let each processor store multiple columns,
  but still do one broadcast per column. Is there a way to have only one
  broadcast per processor?
\end{exercise}
