\Level 0 {Splitting a communicator}
\label{sec:comm-split}

Above we saw several scenarios where it makes sense to divide
\lstinline{MPI_COMM_WORLD} into disjoint subcommunicators.
The command \indexmpiref{MPI_Comm_split} uses a `color' to define
these subcommunicators:
all processes in the old communicator with the same color
wind up in a new communicator together. The old communicator still exists,
so processes now have two different contexts in which to communicate.

The ranking of processes in the new communicator is determined by a `key' value:
in a subcommunicator the process with lowest key is given the lowest rank, et cetera.
Most of the time, there is no reason to use a relative ranking that is different from
the global ranking, so the \indexmpishow{MPI_Comm_rank} value of the global communicator
is a good choice.
Any ties between identical key values are broken by using the rank from the original
communicator.
Thus, specifying zero as the key will also retain the original process ordering.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.4]{procgrid-bcast}
  \caption{Row and column broadcasts in subcommunicators}
  \label{fig:procgrid-bcast}
\end{figure}

Here is one example of communicator splitting. Suppose your processors
are in a two-dimensional grid:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Comm_rank( MPI_COMM_WORLD, &mytid );
proc_i = mytid % proc_column_length;
proc_j = mytid / proc_column_length;
\end{lstlisting}
You can now create a communicator per column:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Comm column_comm;
MPI_Comm_split( MPI_COMM_WORLD, proc_j, mytid, &column_comm );
\end{lstlisting}
and do a broadcast in that column:
\begin{lstlisting}
MPI_Bcast( data, /* stuff */, column_comm );
\end{lstlisting}
Because of the SPMD nature of the program, you are now doing in parallel
a broadcast in every processor column. Such operations often appear
in \indexterm{dense linear algebra}.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:rowcolcomm}
  Organize your processes in a grid, and make subcommunicators for
  the rows and columns. For this compute the row and column number of
  each process.

  In the row and column communicator, compute the rank. For instance,
  on a $2\times3$ processor grid you should find:
\begin{verbatim}
Global ranks:  Ranks in row:  Ranks in colum:
  0  1  2      0  1  2        0  0  0
  3  4  5      0  1  2        1  1  1
\end{verbatim}

  Check that the rank in the row communicator is the column number,
  and the other way around.

  Run your code on different number of processes, for instance a
  number of rows and columns that is a power of~2, or that is a prime number.
\begin{tacc}
    This is one occasion where you could use \n{ibrun -np 9};
    normally you would \emph{never} put a processor count on \n{ibrun}.
\end{tacc}
  \skeleton{procgrid}
\end{exercise}

\begin{remark}
  A process that sets the \lstinline{color} parameter to
  \indexmpishow{MPI_UNDEFINED},
  receives a communicator value of \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_NULL},
  that is, it will not be part of any created subcommunicator.
\end{remark}

\begin{pythonnote}{Comm split key is optional}
  In Python, the `key' argument is optional:
  %
  \psnippetwithoutput{commsplitp}{examples/mpi/p}{dup}
\end{pythonnote}

\begin{mplnote}{Communicator splitting}
  \label{mpl::split}
  In \ac{MPL}, splitting a communicator is done as one of the overloads
  of the communicator constructor;
  %
  \mplverbatimsnippet[examples/mpi/mpl/commsplit.cxx]{commsplitmpl}

  \begin{mplimpl}
    The \lstinline+communicator::+\indexmpldef{split} identifier
    is an object of class
    \lstinline+communicator::+\indexmpldef{split_tag},
    itself is an otherwise empty
    subclass of \indexmplshow{communicator}:
\begin{lstlisting}
class split_tag {};
static constexpr split_tag split{};
\end{lstlisting}
  \end{mplimpl}
\end{mplnote}


As another example of communicator splitting, consider the recursive
algorithm for \indextermbus{matrix}{transposition}.
%
\index{transpose!recursive}
%
Processors are organized in a square grid. The matrix is divided
on $2\times 2$ block form.

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:recursivetranspose}
  Implement a recursive algorithm for matrix transposition:
  
  \includegraphics[scale=.06]{recursive-transpose}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Swap blocks $(1,2)$ and $(2,1)$; then
  \item Divide the processors into four subcommunicators, and
    apply this algorithm recursively on each;
  \item If the communicator has only one process, transpose the matrix in place.
  \end{itemize}
  (assume one element per process)
\end{exercise}

\Level 1 {Splitting by type}
\label{mpi-comm-split-type}

There is also a routine \indexmpiref{MPI_Comm_split_type}
which uses a type rather than a key to split the communicator.

Here the \n{split_type} parameter has to be from the following (short) list:
\begin{itemize}
\item \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_TYPE_SHARED}: split the communicator into subcommunicators
  of processes sharing a memory area.
  We will see this in action in section~\ref{mpi-comm-split-shared}.
\begin{mpifournote}{Split by guided types}
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_TYPE_HW_GUIDED} (\mpistandard{4}):
    split using an \n{info} value from \indexmpidef{MPI_Get_hw_resource_types}.
    % https://github.com/mpi-forum/mpi-issues/issues/132
    The function \indexmpidef{MPI_Get_hw_resource_info}
    (as of \mpistandard{4.1}) returns an \indexmpishow{MPI_Info}
    object containing key/value pairs of available hardware resources.
    (See section~\ref{sec:mpi-info} for how to unpack info objects.)
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_TYPE_HW_UNGUIDED} (\mpistandard{4}):
    similar to \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_TYPE_HW_GUIDED}, but the resulting communicators
    should be a strict subset of the original communicator.
    On processes where this condition can not be fullfilled,
    \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_NULL} will be returned.
  \item \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_TYPE_RESOURCE_GUIDED} (\mpistandard{4.1}):
    this splits a communicator by
    \begin{itemize}
    \item
      Hardware properties.
      For this case there is the info key \indextermtt{mpi_hw_resource_type}.
      One possible key value \indextermtt{mpi_shared_memory} effects
      the same split as using the split type \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_TYPE_SHARED}.
    \item \n{pset} names.
      For this case there is the info key \indextermtt{mpi_pset_name}.
      If a communicator is not derived from a session, the split communicator
      will be \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_NULL}.
    \end{itemize}

\end{mpifournote}
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
  The \indexterm{OpenMPI} implementation of MPI has a number of
  non-standard split types, such as \indexmpishow{OMPI_COMM_TYPE_SOCKET};
  see \url{https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v4.1/man3/MPI_Comm_split_type.3.php}
