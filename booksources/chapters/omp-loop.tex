\Level 0 {Loop parallelism}
\label{sec:omp-for}

Loop parallelism is a very common type of parallelism in scientific
codes, so OpenMP has an easy mechanism for it.
OpenMP parallel loops are a first example of OpenMP `worksharing'
constructs (see section~\ref{sec:work-sharing} for the full list):
constructs that take an amount of work and distribute it over the
available threads in a parallel region,
created with the \indexpragma{parallel} pragma.

The parallel execution of a loop can be handled a number of different ways.
For instance, you can create a parallel region around the loop, and
adjust the loop bounds:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel
{
  int threadnum = omp_get_thread_num(),
    numthreads = omp_get_num_threads();
  int low = N*threadnum/numthreads,
    high = N*(threadnum+1)/numthreads;
  for (i=low; i<high; i++)
    // do something with i
}
\end{lstlisting}
In effect, this is how you would parallelize a loop in MPI.
\begin{exercise}
  What is an important difference between the resulting OpenMP and MPI code?
\end{exercise}

A more natural option is to use the
\indexpragma{for} pragma:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel
#pragma omp for
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
  // do something with i
}
\end{lstlisting}
This has several advantages. For one, you don't have to calculate the loop bounds
for the threads yourself, but you can also tell OpenMP to assign the loop
iterations according to different schedules (section~\ref{sec:schedule}).

\begin{fortrannote}{OMP do pragma}
  The \indexpragma{for} pragma only exists in~C;
  there is a correspondingly named \indexpragma{do} pragma in Fortran.
\begin{lstlisting}
$!omp parallel
$!omp do
  do i=1,N
    ! something with i
  end do
$!omp end do
$!omp end parallel
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fortrannote}

Figure~\ref{fig:omp-par-do} shows the execution on four threads of
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel
{
  code1();
#pragma omp for
  for (i=1; i<=4*N; i++) {
    code2();
  }
  code3();
}
\end{lstlisting}
The code before and after the loop is executed identically
in each thread; the loop iterations are spread over the four threads.
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.1]{parallel-do}
  \caption{Execution of parallel code inside and outside a loop}
  \label{fig:omp-par-do}
\end{figure}

Note that the \n{do} and \n{for}
pragmas do not create a team of threads: they
take the team of threads that is active,
and divide the loop iterations over them.
This means that the \n{omp for} or \n{omp do} directive needs to be
inside a parallel region.

As an illustration:
\csnippetwithoutput{ompparforthread}{examples/omp/c}{parfor}

\begin{exercise}
  What would happen in the above example if you increase the number of threads
  to be larger than the number of cores?
\end{exercise}

It is also possible to have a combined
\n{omp parallel for} or \n{omp parallel do} directive.
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for
  for (i=0; .....
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 1 {Loops are static}

There are some restrictions on the loop: basically, OpenMP needs to be
able to determine in advance how many iterations there will be.
\begin{itemize}
\item The loop can not contains \n{break}, \n{return}, \n{exit} statements, or
  \n{goto} to a label outside the loop.
\item The \indextermttnote{continue|in OpenMP loops} (for~C/C++)
  or \indextermttnote{cycle|in OpenMP loops} (for Fortran)
  statement is allowed.
\item The index update has to be an increment (or decrement) by a fixed amount.
\item The loop index variable is automatically private, and not changes to it
  inside the loop are allowed.
  The following loop is not parallelizable in OpenMP:
    \begin{lstlisting}
      for (int i=0; i<N; ) {
        // something
        if (something)
        i++;
        else
        i += 2;
      }
    \end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
  The loop index needs to be an integer value
  for the loop to be parallelizable.
  Unsigned values are allowed as of \ompstandard{3}.
\end{remark}

\Level 1 {Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:omp-pi}
  Compute $\pi$ by \indexterm{numerical integration}. We use the fact that $\pi$
  is the area of the unit circle, and we approximate this by computing
  the area of a quarter circle using \indexterm{Riemann sums}.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Let $f(x)=\sqrt{1-x^2}$ be the function that describes the
    quarter circle for $x=0\ldots 1$;
  \item Then we compute \[ \pi/4\approx\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \Delta x
    f(x_i) \qquad \hbox{where $x_i=i\Delta x$ and $\Delta x=1/N$} \]
  \end{itemize}
  Write a program for this, and parallelize it using OpenMP parallel
  for directives.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Put a \indexompshow{parallel} directive around your loop. Does it still
    compute the right result? Does the time go down with the number of
    threads? (The answers should be no and no.)
  \item Change the \lstinline{parallel} to \lstinline{parallel for}
    (or \lstinline{parallel do}). Now is the result correct? Does execution speed up? (The
    answers should now be no and yes.)
  \item Put a \indexompshow{critical} directive in front of the update. (Yes and
    very much no.)
  \item Remove the \indexompshow{critical} and add a clause
    \indexompshow{reduction}\n{(+:quarterpi)} to the \indexompshow{for} directive.
    Now it should be correct and efficient.
  \end{enumerate}
  Use different numbers of cores and compute the
  speedup you attain over the sequential computation. Is there a
  performance difference between the OpenMP code with 1~thread and the
  sequential code?
\end{exercise}

\begin{remark}
  In this exercise you may have seen the runtime go up a couple of times
  where you weren't expecting it. The issue here is \indexterm{false
    sharing}; see~\HPSCref{sec:roundoff-parallel} for more explanation.
\end{remark}

\Level 0 {An example}

To illustrate the speedup of perfectly parallel calculations,
we consider a simple code that applies the same calculation
to each element of an array.

All tests are done on the \indextermbus{TACC}{Frontera} cluster,
which has dual-socket \indextermbus{Intel}{Cascade Lake} nodes,
with a total of 56 cores.
We control affinity by setting
\n{OMP_PROC_BIND=true}.

Here is the essential code fragment:
\cverbatimsnippet{ompsineloop}

\begin{exercise}
  Verify that the outer loop is parallel, but the inner one is not.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Compare the time for the sequential code and the single-threaded OpenMP code.
  Try different optimization levels, and different compilers if you have them.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Do you sometimes get a significant difference? What would be an explanation?
  \item Does your compiler have a facility for generating optimization reports?
    For instance \n{-qoptreport=5} for the
    \emph{Intel compiler}\index{Intel!compiler!optimization report}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

Now we investigate the influence of two parameters:
\begin{enumerate}
\item the OpenMP thread count: while we have 56 cores, values larger than that are allowed; and
\item the size of the problem: the smaller the problem, the larger the relative overhead
  of creating and synchronizing the team of threads.
\end{enumerate}
We execute the above computation several times to even out effects of cache loading.

The results are in figure~\ref{fig:omp-speedup}:
\begin{itemize}
\item While the problem size is always larger than the number of threads,
  only for the largest problem,
  which has at least 400 points per thread,
  is the speedup essentially linear.
\item OpenMP allows for the number of threads to be larger than the core count,
  but there is no performance improvement in doing so.

The above tests did not use \indexterm{hyperthread}s,
since that is disabled on Frontera.
However, the \indextermbus{Intel}{Knights Landing} nodes
of the \indextermbus{TACC}{Stampede2} cluster
have four \indexterm{hyperthread}s per core.
Table~\ref{fig:omp-speed-hyper} shows that this will indeed give a modest speedup.

For reference, the commandlines executed were:
\begin{verbatim}
# frontera
  make localclean run_speedup EXTRA_OPTIONS=-DN=200 NDIV=8 NP=112
  make localclean run_speedup EXTRA_OPTIONS=-DN=2000 NDIV=8 NP=112

# stampede2
  make localclean run_speedup NDIV=8 EXTRA_OPTIONS="-DN=200000 -DM=1000" NP=272
\end{verbatim}

\begin{cppnote}{Range syntax}
  Parallel loops in can use range-based syntax as of \ompstandard{5.0}:
  %
  \cxxverbatimsnippet{ompcxxloop}
  %
  Tests not reported here show exactly the same speedup as the C~code.
\end{cppnote}

\Level 0 {Loop schedules}
\label{sec:schedule}

Usually you will have many more iterations in a loop than there are threads.
Thus, there are several ways you can assign your loop iterations to the threads.
OpenMP lets you specify this with the \indexompshow{schedule} clause.
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp for schedule(....)
\end{lstlisting}

The first distinction we now have to make is between static and dynamic schedules.
With static schedules, the iterations are assigned purely based on the number
of iterations and the number of threads (and the \indexompshow{chunk} parameter; see later).
In dynamic schedules, on the other hand, iterations are assigned to threads that
are unoccupied. Dynamic schedules are a good idea if iterations take an unpredictable
amount of time, so that \indextermbus{load}{balancing} is needed.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.07]{scheduling}
  \caption{Illustration static round-robin scheduling versus dynamic}
  \label{fig:omp-robin}
\end{figure}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:omp-robin} illustrates this: assume that each core
gets assigned two (blocks of) iterations and these blocks take
gradually less and less time. You see from the left picture that
thread~1 gets two fairly long blocks, where as thread~4 gets two short
blocks, thus finishing much earlier. (This phenomenon of threads
having unequal amounts of work is known as
\indextermbus{load}{imbalance}.)
On the other hand, in the right figure thread~4 gets
block~5, since it finishes the first set of blocks early. The effect
is a perfect load balancing.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \includegraphics[scale=.12]{schedules}
  \caption{Illustration of the scheduling strategies of loop iterations}
  \label{fig:omp-schedule}
\end{figure}

The default static schedule is to assign one consecutive block of
iterations to each thread. If you want different sized blocks you can
define a \indexclauseoption{schedule}{chunk} size:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp for schedule(static[,chunk])
\end{lstlisting}
(where the square brackets indicate an optional argument).
With static scheduling,
the compiler will determine the assignment of loop iterations to the threads
at compile time,
so,
provided the iterations take roughly the same amount of time,
this is the most efficient at runtime.

The choice of a chunk size is often a balance between the low overhead of having 
only a few chunks, versus the load balancing effect of having smaller chunks.
\begin{exercise}
  Why is a chunk size of~1 typically a bad idea? (Hint: think about
  cache lines, and read \HPSCref{sec:falseshare}.)
\end{exercise}

In dynamic scheduling OpenMP will put blocks of iterations
(the default chunk size is~1) in a task queue, and the threads take one of these
tasks whenever they are finished with the previous.
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp for schedule(static[,chunk])
\end{lstlisting}
While this schedule may give good load balancing if the iterations
take very differing amounts of time to execute, it does carry runtime
overhead for managing the queue of iteration tasks.

Finally, there is the \indexclauseoption{schedule}{guided} schedule, which gradually decreases the chunk size.
The thinking here is that large chunks carry the least overhead, but smaller chunks are better
for load balancing.
%
The various schedules are illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:omp-schedule}.

If you don't want to decide on a schedule in your code, you can
specify the \indexclauseoption{schedule}{runtime} schedule. The actual
schedule will then at runtime be read from the
\indexompshow{OMP_SCHEDULE} environment variable. You can even just
leave it to the runtime library by specifying
\indexclauseoption{schedule}{auto}

\begin{exercise}
  \label{ex:omp-pi-adapt}
  %
  We continue with exercise~\ref{ex:omp-pi}.
  We add `adaptive integration'%
  \index{adaptive integration|see{quadrature, adaptive}}\index{quadrature!adaptive}:
  where needed, the program refines the step
  size\footnote{It doesn't actually do this in a mathematically
    sophisticated way, so this code is more for the sake of the
    example.}.  This means that the iterations no longer take a
  predictable amount of time.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{lstlisting}
for (i=0; i<nsteps; i++) {
    double
    x = i*h,x2 = (i+1)*h,
    y = sqrt(1-x*x),y2 = sqrt(1-x2*x2),
    slope = (y-y2)/h;
    if (slope>15) slope = 15;
    int
    samples = 1+(int)slope, is;
    for (is=0; is<samples; is++) {
        double
        hs = h/samples,
        xs = x+ is*hs,
        ys = sqrt(1-xs*xs);
        quarterpi += hs*ys;
        nsamples++;
    }
}
  pi = 4*quarterpi;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{multicols}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Use the \lstinline{omp parallel for} construct to parallelize the loop.
  As in the previous lab, you may at first see an incorrect result.
  Use the \indexompshow{reduction} clause to fix this.
\item Your code should now see a decent speedup, but possible not for all cores.
  It is possible to get completely linear speedup by adjusting the schedule.

  Start by using \indexompshow{schedule}\lstinline{(static,n)}.
  Experiment with values for~$n$.
  When can you get a better speedup? Explain this.
\item Since this code is somewhat dynamic, try \indexompshow{schedule}\lstinline{(dynamic)}.
  This will actually give a fairly bad result. Why?  Use
  \indexompshow{schedule}\n{(dynamic,$n$)} instead, and experiment with values
  for~$n$.
\item Finally, use \indexompshow{schedule}\lstinline{(guided)}, where OpenMP uses a
  heuristic.  What results does that give?
\end{enumerate}
     
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Program the \indexterm{LU factorization} algorithm without pivoting.
\begin{lstlisting}
for k=1,n:
  A[k,k] = 1./A[k,k]
  for i=k+1,n:
    A[i,k] = A[i,k]/A[k,k]
    for j=k+1,n:
      A[i,j] = A[i,j] - A[i,k]*A[k,j]
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Argue that it is not possible to parallelize the outer loop.
\item Argue that it is possible to parallelize both the $i$ and $j$ loops.
\item Parallelize the algorithm by focusing on the $i$ loop. Why is the algorithm as given here best
  for a matrix on row-storage? What would you do if the matrix was on column storage?
\item Argue that with the default schedule, if a row is updated by one thread in one iteration,
  it may very well be updated by another thread in another. Can you find a way to schedule
  loop iterations so that this does not happen? What practical reason is there for doing so?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

The schedule can be declared explicitly, set at runtime
through the \indexompshow{OMP_SCHEDULE} environment variable, or left up to the runtime system
by specifying \lstinline{auto}. Especially in the last two cases  you may want to enquire
what schedule is currently being used with
\indexompshow{omp_get_schedule}.
\begin{lstlisting}
int omp_get_schedule(omp_sched_t * kind, int * modifier );
\end{lstlisting}

Its mirror call is \indexompshow{omp_set_schedule}, which sets the
value that is used when schedule value \lstinline{runtime} is used. It is in
effect equivalent to setting the environment variable
\indexompshow{OMP_SCHEDULE}.
\begin{lstlisting}
void omp_set_schedule (omp_sched_t kind, int modifier);
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{tabular}{llllrr}
  \toprule
  Type&environment variable&clause&\indexompshow{omp_sched_t}&\indexompshow{omp_sched_t}&modifier default\\
        &{\tt OMP\_SCHEDULE\char`\=}&{\tt schedule( ... )}&name&value \\
  \midrule
  static&\texttt{static[,n]}&{static[,n]}&\indexompshow{omp_sched_static}&1&$N/\mathit{nthreads}$\\
  dynamic&\texttt{dynamic[,n]}&{dynamic[,n]}&\indexompshow{omp_sched_dynamic}&2&$1$\\
  guided&\texttt{guided[,n]}&{guided[,n]}&\indexompshow{omp_sched_guided}&3\\
  auto&\texttt{auto}&auto&\indexompshow{omp_sched_auto}&4\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

Here are the various schedules you can set with the
\indexompshow{schedule} clause:
\begin{description}
  \item[affinity] Set by using value  \indexompshow{omp_sched_affinity}
  \item[auto] The schedule is left up to the implementation. Set by
    using value \indexompshow{omp_sched_auto}
  \item[static] value:~1. The modifier parameter is the \indexterm{chunk} size.
    Can also be set by using value  \indexompshow{omp_sched_static}
  \item[dynamic] value:~2. The modifier parameter is the
    \indexterm{chunk} size; default~1.
    Can also be set by using value
    \indexompshow{omp_sched_dynamic}
  \item[guided] Value:~3. The modifier parameter is the
    \indextermtt{chunk} size. Set by using value
    \indexompshow{omp_sched_guided}
  \item[runtime] Use the value of the \indexompshow{OMP_SCHEDULE}
    environment variable. Set by using value
    \indexompshow{omp_sched_runtime}
\end{description}

\Level 0 {Reductions}

So far we have focused on loops with independent iterations.
Reductions are a common type of loop with dependencies.
There is an extended discussion of reductions in section~\ref{sec:reduction}.

\Level 0 {Collapsing nested loops}

In general, the more work there is to divide over a number of threads,
the more efficient the parallelization will be. In the context of
parallel loops, it is possible to increase the amount of work by
parallelizing all levels of loops instead of just the outer one.

Example: in
\begin{lstlisting}
for ( i=0; i<N; i++ )
  for ( j=0; j<N; j++ )
    A[i][j] = B[i][j] + C[i][j] 
\end{lstlisting}
all $N^2$ iterations are independent, but a regular \lstinline{omp for}
directive will only parallelize one level. The \indexclause{collapse}
clause will parallelize more than one level:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp for collapse(2)
for ( i=0; i<N; i++ )
  for ( j=0; j<N; j++ )
    A[i][j] = B[i][j] + C[i][j] 
\end{lstlisting}
It is only possible to collapse perfectly nested loops, that is, the
loop body of the outer loop can consist only of the inner loop; there
can be no statements before or after the inner loop in the loop body
of the outer loop. That is, the two loops in
\begin{lstlisting}
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
  y[i] = 0.;
  for (j=0; j<N; j++)
    y[i] += A[i][j] * x[j]
}
\end{lstlisting}
can not be collapsed.

\begin{exercise}
  You could rewrite the above code as
\begin{lstlisting}
for (i=0; i<N; i++)
  y[i] = 0.;
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
  for (j=0; j<N; j++)
    y[i] += A[i][j] * x[j]
}
\end{lstlisting}
Is it now correct to have the \indexompshow{collapse} directive
on the nested loop?
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Consider this code for matrix transposition:
\begin{lstlisting}
void transposer(int n, int m, double *dst, const double *src) {
   int blocksize;
   for (int i = 0; i < n; i += blocksize) {
      for (int j = 0; j < m; j += blocksize) {
          // transpose the block beginning at [i,j]
          for (int k = i; k < i + blocksize; ++k) {
              for (int l = j; l < j + blocksize; ++l) {
                  dst[k + l*n] = src[l + k*m];
               }
          }
      }
   }
}  
\end{lstlisting}
Assuming that the \lstinline{src} and \lstinline{dst}
array are disjoint, which loops are parallel, and how many
levels can you collapse?
\end{exercise}

\Level 0 {Ordered iterations}
\label{sec:omp-ordered}

Iterations in a parallel loop that are executed in parallel do not
execute in lockstep. That means that in
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for
for ( ... i ... ) {
  ... f(i) ...
  printf("something with %d\n",i);
}
\end{lstlisting}
it is not true that all function evaluations happen more or less at
the same time, followed by all print statements. The print statements
can really happen in any order. The \indexclause{ordered} clause
coupled with the \indexpragma{ordered} directive can
force execution in the right order:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for ordered
for ( ... i ... ) {
  ... f(i) ...
#pragma omp ordered
  printf("something with %d\n",i);
}
\end{lstlisting}
Example code structure:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel for shared(y) ordered
for ( ... i ... ) {
  int x = f(i)
#pragma omp ordered
  y[i] += f(x)
  z[i] = g(y[i])
}
\end{lstlisting}
There is a limitation:
each iteration can encounter only one \indexompshow{ordered} directive.

\Level 0 {\texttt{nowait}}
\label{sec:omp-nowait}

The implicit barrier at the end of a work sharing construct
can be cancelled with a
\indexclause{nowait}\index[omp]{barrier!cancelled by nowait} clause.
This has the effect that threads that are finished can continue
with the next code in the parallel region:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel
{
#pragma omp for nowait
  for (i=0; i<N; i++) { ... }
  // more parallel code
}
\end{lstlisting}

In the following example, threads that are finished with the first loop
can start on the second. Note that this requires both loops to have
the same schedule. We specify the static schedule here to have an
identical scheduling of iterations over threads:
\begin{lstlisting}
#pragma omp parallel
{
  x = local_computation()
#pragma omp for schedule(static) nowait
  for (i=0; i<N; i++) { 
    x[i] = ... 
  }
#pragma omp for schedule(static)
  for (i=0; i<N; i++) { 
    y[i] = ... x[i] ...
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\Level 0 {While loops}

OpenMP can only handle `for' loops: \indexterm{while loops} can not
be parallelized. So you have to find a way around that. While loops
are for instance used to search through data:
\begin{lstlisting}
while ( a[i]!=0 && i<imax ) {
 i++; }
// now i is the first index for which \n{a[i]} is zero.
\end{lstlisting}
We replace the while loop by a for loop that examines all locations:
\begin{lstlisting}
result = -1;
#pragma omp parallel for
for (i=0; i<imax; i++) {
  if (a[i]!=0 && result<0) result = i;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{exercise}
  Show that this code has a race condition.
\end{exercise}
You can fix the race condition by making the condition into a critical section;
section~\ref{sec:critical}. In this particular example, with a very small amount
of work per iteration, that is likely to be inefficient 
in this case (why?).
A~more efficient solution uses the \indexpragma{lastprivate} pragma:
\begin{lstlisting}
result = -1;
#pragma omp parallel for lastprivate(result)
for (i=0; i<imax; i++) {
  if (a[i]!=0) result = i;
}
\end{lstlisting}
You have now solved a slightly different problem: the result variable
contains the \emph{last} location where \n{a[i]} is zero.

For all core counts to half the total,
performance for all binding strategies seems equal.
After that , \n{close} and \n{spread} perform equally,
but the speedup for the \n{false} value gives erratic numbers.

Dual 24-core \indextermbus{Intel}{Skylake};

We see that \n{close} binding gives worse performance than \n{spread}.
Setting binding to \n{false} only gives bad performance for large core counts.

\Level 1 {Stampede2 Knights Landing}

Single socket 68-core \indextermbus{Intel}{Knights Landing};
\ref{fig:knl-bind}.

Since this is a single socket design,
we don't distinguish between the \n{close} and \n{spread} binding.
However, the binding value of \n{true} shows good speedup
--~in fact beyond the core count~--
while \n{false} gives worse performance than in other architectures.

Unlike the Intel processors, here we use the hyperthreads.
Figure~\ref{fig:longhorn-bind} shows dip in the speedup
at 40 threads.
For higher thread counts the speedup increases to well beyond the
physical core count of~$40$.

\Level 1 {Array traversal}
\label{sec:omp-row-col-major}

Consider arrays 
\begin{lstlisting}
  float Amat[N][N];
  float xvec[N],yvec[N];  
\end{lstlisting}
and the operation $s\leftarrow y^tAx$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Code this as an OpenMP parallel double loop.
\item Argue that the matrix $A$ can be traversed two ways:
  by rows and columns, or by columns and rows, both
  giving the same result (in exact arithmetic).
\item Argue that the loops can be collapsed with \indexompshow{collapse}
  directory.
\item So now you have 4 variants in addition to the sequential code.
  Time these.
\end{enumerate}

You should find that the row/column (or \indexterm{row-major}) variant
is faster. Can you find reasons for this?

\Level 0 {Review questions}

\begin{exercise}
  The following loop can be parallelized with a \lstinline+parallel for+.
  Is it correct to add the directive \lstinline+collapse(2)+?

\begin{lstlisting}
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
  y[i] = 0.;
  for (j=0; j<N; j++)
  y[i] += A[i][j] * x[j]
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Same question for the nested loop here:

\begin{lstlisting}
for (i=0; i<N; i++)
y[i] = 0.;
for (i=0; i<N; i++) {
  for (j=0; j<N; j++)
  y[i] += A[i][j] * x[j]
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  In this triple loop:
\begin{lstlisting}
for (int i=0; i<n; i++)
  for (int j=0; j<n; j++)
    for (int k=0; k<kmax; k++)
      x[i][j] += f(i,j,k)
\end{lstlisting}
what OpenMP directives do you use?
Can you collapse all levels?
Does it matter what the loop bounds are?
\end{exercise}
