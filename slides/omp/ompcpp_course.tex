\maketitle

\begin{frame}{Justification}
  OpenMP has the opportunity to exploit features of modern~C++
  that are not present in C.
  In this course we will explore:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    range-based iteration,
  \item
    differences in treatment between vectors and arrays,
    and various sophisticated reduction schemes.
  \end{itemize}
