  \begin{itemize}
  \item Derived data types: send strided/irregular/inhomogeneous data
  \item Sub-communicators: work with subsets of \indexmpishow{MPI_COMM_WORLD}
  \item I/O: efficient file operations
  \item One-sided communication: `just' put/get the data somewhere
  \item Process management
  \item Non-blocking collectives
  \item Graph topology and neighborhood collectives
  \item Shared memory
